# umm-spec-lib

The UMM Spec lib contains JSON schemas that defined the Unified Metadata Model. The UMM defines common data structures for representing metadata. The UMM Spec Lib also contains mappings between the XML metadata standards (ECHO10, DIF 9, DIF 10, ISO 19115 SMAP and ISO 19115 MENDS) and the UMM. The UMM is represented as Clojure records in the UMM Spec lib. The mappings provide a way for programmatic conversion between XML and UMM.

## Library Layout

Lists major parts of the library.

  * src/cmr/umm-spec/
    * models/ - Contains clojure namespaces that were generated from the UMM JSON schemas.
    * json_schema.clj - Contains code for loading JSON schemas.
    * record_generator.clj - Generates clojure records from json schemas. Must be manually done when the JSON schemas are updated.
    * umm_mappings/* - Code that defines the XML to UMM Mapping DSL, XML Parser, and uses of the DSL to define the mappings between formats.
    * xml_mappings/* - Code that defines the UMM to XML Mapping DSL, XML Generator, and uses of the DSL to define the mappings between formats.
  * resources/
    * json-schemas/ - Contains the UMM JSON schemas


## Generating Clojure Records from UMM JSON Schemas

The JSON schemas in `resource/json-schemas` define the structure of the UMM. These are used as source documents for generating Clojure records that can store the same data as the UMM. The records are generated into `src/cmr/umm-spec/models`.

JSON schemas can define complex types like the following example:

```
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#",
  "title": "Book",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "Author": {
      "description": "The author of this book",
      "$ref": "umm-cmn-json-schema.json#/definitions/AuthorType"
    },
    "Title": {
      "description": "The title of the book",
      "type": "string"
    }
  }
}
```

That defines a Book type as the root of the schema which has an Author and a Title. The Author is a type defined in another schema and Title is a string.

We would like to represent a Book type in Clojure like the following

```
(defrecord Book
  [
   ;; The author of this book
   Author

   ;; The title of the book
   Title
  ])
```

The code in `cmr.umm-spec.record-generator` can generate records from a schema. The UMM Clojure records can be generated by running `lein generate-umm-records` in this project.

## Implementing mapping for a new field

Adding mappings for a new or existing field in the UMM should be done at the same time across all formats.

### 1. Obtain the XPaths and example XML samples.

Contact Erich Reiter (erich.e.reiter@nasa.gov) to obtain these.

### 2. Implement tests for each format.

Add roundtrip conversion tests for each format in `cmr.umm-spec.test.generate-and-parse`

### 3. Implement the UMM to XML mappings for each format.

The UMM to XML mappings are in files named `src/cmr/umm_spec/xml_mappings/<format>.clj`

See the DSL documentation and existing formats for examples.

### 4. Implement the XML to UMM mappings for each format.

The XML to UMM mappings are in files named `src/cmr/umm_spec/umm_mappings/<format>.clj`

See the DSL documentation and existing formats for examples.
