   ;; example of a dimension size is '1200'. Variables are rarely one dimensional.

   ;; The factor by which the cell value has been multiplied. The cell value is the value given to a
   ;; specific location within an array of data values. An example of a scale factor is '0.002'

   ;; The factor to which the cell value has been added. The cell value is the value given to a
   ;; specific location within an array of data values. An example of an offset is '0.49'.

   ;; The set information of a variable. The variable is grouped within a set. The set is defined by
   ;; the name, type, size and index. For example, Name: 'Data_Fields', Type: 'General', Size: '15',

   Units

   ;; The fill value of the variable in the data file. It is generally a value which falls outside
   ;; the valid range. For example, if the valid range is '0, 360', the fill value may be '-1'. The
   ;; fill value type is data provider-defined. For example, 'Out of Valid Range'.
